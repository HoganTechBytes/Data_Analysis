# Data Analysis Practice Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my **hands-on data analysis practice work**, primarily focused on **SQL** and **relational database concepts**, with supporting analysis and documentation.

The projects here are part of a **deliberate skill-polishing effort**, following along with a public YouTube tutorial series while:
- Writing queries myself
- Adjusting schemas where appropriate
- Applying real-world reasoning from prior analyst experience
- Version-controlling all work for clarity and reproducibility

This repository is intended to demonstrate **how I think with data**, not just final outputs.

---

## Purpose of This Repository
- Refresh and strengthen SQL fundamentals (joins, aggregations, filtering)
- Rebuild analyst fluency after time away from academic SQL work
- Practice professional workflows (scripts, Git, documentation)
- Create transparent, reviewable artifacts suitable for discussion with potential employers

While the structure and datasets are guided by a tutorial, **all SQL is typed, run, and reasoned through manually**, with notes and adjustments based on best practices.

---

## Current Focus Areas
- Relational database design
- INNER, LEFT, and OUTER join behavior
- Translating business questions into SQL queries
- Writing readable, maintainable SQL scripts
- Using Git for versioned analytical work
